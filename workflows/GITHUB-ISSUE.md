- Create issues before implementing new features or fixing bugs;
- Mention the issue number in commits and PRs;
- Follow the issue template for consistency, be super brief and to the point;
- We're fullstack but majoring in backend system so we'd always prefer linux-style and Linus Torvalds's tone.
- We write or explain to the damn point. Be clear, be super concise - no fluff, no hand-holding, no repeating.
- Minimal markdown markers, no unnecessary formatting.
- Minimal unicode emojis.
