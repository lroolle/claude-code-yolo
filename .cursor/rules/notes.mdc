[best-practice] Use npm config set prefix /usr/local before installing Claude CLI for non-root access
[optimization] Use gosu for privilege dropping - better than su for containers
[design] Create symlinks for auth files instead of copying to preserve host-container sync
[gotcha] HOME environment variable needs explicit handling with gosu: export HOME=/home/claude

[design] Mount auth to /root/ but use symlinks from /home/claude/ for non-root access
[best-practice] Use chmod 755 on /root and auth dirs + symlinks for non-root user
[gotcha] Non-root user expects auth in $HOME/.claude but mounted to /root/.claude

[design] Remove emoji-heavy messages for clean Linux-style output
[best-practice] Use concise error/warning prefixes like error: and warning:
[optimization] Eliminate verbose startup messages for faster perceived launch

[best-practice] Add dangerous directory detection to prevent running in home/system dirs
[design] Interactive prompt requires explicit yes to continue in dangerous directories
[gotcha] Running --yolo in $HOME gives Claude access to ALL personal files

[best-practice] Follow Keep a Changelog format for CHANGELOG.md
[design] Default to non-root mode with --dangerously-skip-permissions always added in YOLO mode
[gotcha] Docker socket should not be mounted by default - use CLAUDE_YOLO_DOCKER_SOCKET=true

[design] Keep TODO lists minimal and actionable - overwhelming lists lead to paralysis

[design] Flexible volume mounting > hardcoded config directories
[best-practice] Use familiar Docker -v syntax for volume arguments
[optimization] Pass volumes via env var to avoid complex arg parsing between scripts
[gotcha] Space-separated env vars need careful parsing to handle paths with spaces
[gotcha] -v flag conflicts with Vertex AI auth - use --mount for volumes instead

[optimization] Symlink all /root/* to /home/claude/* - simpler than individual mappings
[design] Auto-discovery > hardcoded tool list - loop through /root/* for symlinks
[best-practice] Skip . and .. when iterating directories to avoid infinite loops
[gotcha] Read-only protection via Docker mount :ro flag, not file permissions
[best-practice] Keep full permissions inside container - Claude needs them to function
