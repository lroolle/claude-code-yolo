**User**

the main reason for this project `claude-code-yolo` is that we want to run the claude code safely even in the --dangerous-skip-permissions mode

check the references docker files in references diectory.

I'm thinking of... we're building a docker image named claude-code-yolo ourselfves with:

1. auth support claude app / anthropic api key / aws bedrock auth. by mounting the ~/.claude and ~/.claude.json, ~/.aws 
2. full dev env with like python/go/rust and other claude tools setup ready
3. very easy and simple startup like

claude.sh . will do mount the current directory just same path to the docker container, thus we should make claude working like in same machine.

likd $(pwd):($pwd)??

4. pass the proxy envs and keys envs into the docker container
5. should be like from:ubuntu, for easy to setup the development deps
6. ignore firewall first, we don't care network security issue for now

in conclusion, within the container, the claude can do everythig just like within our machine into the docker container, except it does no way to edit or change our local machines files outside current directory. and the claude code will unable to messing up our machines env.

----

Please review my points and the references dockerfiles in @/.devcontainer and the @/claude-code-contained 

First we'll write the@README.md README.md ensure we fully understand what's going to implement 
then we'll like merge the @claudeb.sh in to claude.sh and write the dockerfile, the setup scripts etc.

please think harder.

I'll help you create the `claude-code-yolo` project that safely runs Claude Code in a containerized environment. Let me first review the reference files and understand your requirements, then create a comprehensive README.md to ensure we're aligned on the implementation.

Now let me create a comprehensive README.md that outlines the architecture and approach for the claude-code-yolo project:

# Claude Code YOLO 🚀

A Docker-based solution to safely run Claude Code CLI with full development capabilities while maintaining complete isolation from your host system.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Run Claude Code with `--dangerous-skip-permissions` mode safely by containerizing it with full development environment access, while ensuring it can only modify files within the current directory.

## 🔐 Key Safety Features

- **Directory Isolation**: Claude can only access and modify files in the current working directory
- **Read-only Auth Mounts**: Authentication directories (`~/.claude`, `~/.aws`) are mounted read-only
- **Host Path Preservation**: Current directory is mounted at the same path inside container (e.g., `/Users/eric/project` → `/Users/eric/project`)
- **User Permission Matching**: Container runs with same UID/GID as host user to prevent permission issues

## 🛠️ Architecture

### Docker Image: `claude-code-yolo`
- **Base**: Ubuntu (latest LTS) for easy dependency management
- **Development Tools**: Python, Go, Rust, Node.js, and common development utilities
- **Claude Code CLI**: Pre-installed with both Anthropic API and AWS Bedrock support
- **Shell**: Zsh with oh-my-zsh for better developer experience

### Volume Mounts
1. **Current Directory**: `$(pwd):$(pwd)` - Same path preservation
2. **Authentication** (read-only):
   - `~/.claude:/home/user/.claude:ro`
   - `~/.claude.json:/home/user/.claude.json:ro`
   - `~/.aws:/home/user/.aws:ro`
3. **Shell History**: Persistent bash/zsh history

### Environment Variables
- All proxy settings (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`)
- API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, AWS credentials)
- User settings (`TZ`, `LANG`, etc.)

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run Claude in current directory
./claude.sh .

# Run with specific arguments
./claude.sh chat

# Run with trace logging
./claude.sh --trace .
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Use AWS Bedrock models
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=opus-4 ./claude.sh .

# Use with proxy
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy:8080 ./claude.sh .

# Open a shell in the container
./claude.sh bash
```

## 📦 What's Included

### Development Languages
- **Python 3.12** with pip, venv, popular libs
- **Node.js 20** with npm, yarn, pnpm
- **Go 1.22** with module support
- **Rust** with cargo
- **Ruby 3.3** with bundler
- **Java 21** (OpenJDK)
- **.NET 8** SDK

### Development Tools
- Git with delta diff viewer
- Docker CLI (for Docker-in-Docker scenarios)
- Common editors: vim, neovim, nano
- Build tools: make, cmake, gcc, g++
- Package managers: apt, snap
- CLI tools: jq, yq, httpie, curl, wget
- Process tools: htop, ps, lsof
- File tools: tree, fd, ripgrep, fzf

### Claude-specific Tools
- Claude Code CLI (latest)
- AWS CLI v2 (for Bedrock)
- Claude trace logging support

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create Dockerfile based on Ubuntu
2. Merge claude.sh and claudeb.sh functionality
3. Implement proper volume mounting with path preservation
4. Set up UID/GID matching

### Phase 2: Development Environment
1. Install all development languages and tools
2. Configure shell environment (zsh + oh-my-zsh)
3. Set up proper PATH and environment variables
4. Add development tool configurations

### Phase 3: Claude Integration
1. Install Claude Code CLI
2. Set up authentication mounting
3. Configure AWS Bedrock support
4. Add trace logging capability

### Phase 4: Safety & Convenience
1. Implement entrypoint script for proper initialization
2. Add helper scripts for common tasks
3. Create comprehensive error handling
4. Add update mechanism for Claude CLI

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Path Preservation Strategy
The key insight is mounting the current directory at the exact same path inside the container. This ensures:
- Absolute paths work identically
- Relative paths work identically  
- Claude's file operations map 1:1 with host filesystem
- No path translation needed

### Permission Handling
- Container user created with same UID/GID as host user
- All files created have correct ownership
- No `sudo` needed for file operations
- Claude runs as non-root user

### Network Configuration
- All network access allowed (no firewall restrictions)
- Proxy settings passed through
- DNS resolution works normally
- Can install packages and dependencies

```

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t claude-code-yolo .
   ```

2. Run Claude in your project:
   ```bash
   ./claude.sh .
   ```

3. Claude now has full access to your current directory with all development tools available!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Claude can execute ANY command within the container
- All changes are limited to the mounted directory
- Container has no access to other host directories
- Authentication tokens are read-only
- Container runs with `--dangerous-skip-permissions` by default

## 🔄 Updates

To update Claude Code CLI:
```bash
# Rebuild image with latest Claude
docker build --no-cache -t claude-code-yolo .
```

This design provides the perfect balance of:
- 🛡️ **Safety**: Complete isolation from host system
- 🚀 **Power**: Full development environment access
- 🎯 **Simplicity**: Works just like running Claude locally
- 🔧 **Flexibility**: Supports both Anthropic API and AWS Bedrock
```

You're absolutely right! Let me update the README.md to reflect the correct approach:

<user_feedback>
actually it's impossible to  mount ~/.claude read-only, claude code needs it full permission.

and i think we should keep the way we're using the claude.sh for now

not like ./claude.sh bash or ./claude.sh chat

the new feature for claude.sh we're now going to implement is that it will launch a docker container and run claude with in the docker container with necessary envs

please update our docs first
